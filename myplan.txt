Midi Detection: 
- provides a list of connected midi device options
- lets the user pick which device to use 
- provides a refresh button 


Prebuilt sound library: users will pick from a list of presets, or hit custom preset to build their own sound
Presets = this is going to be empty for now. when users go to chose, only display the custom option for them to select 

Controls: organize in order
Sliders: 
- Oscillators
- - User will pick between 1-3 oscillators
- - - user will also pick the kind of wave form
- mono (button)
- - will have a box to check whether user wants to use it or not. 
- - if selected, different kind of slide happens, itll be like a weird slide inbetween notes, not upon the start of the note
- Glide
- 4master (gain)
- Delay Mix
- 
- Reverb Mix
- 
- Distortion Drive
- I want the layout to look something like this...
- - (section1) Oscillators 
- - (section2) Delay (only slider) 
- - (section3) Reverb (only slider)
- - (section4) Glide (only slider) 
- - (section5) Mono (only button)
